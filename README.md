```

3. Change into the project directory:

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the necessary API keys and settings for Spotify and YouTube. Follow these steps:

1. **Spotify Configuration:**

   - Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create a new application to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret.
   - Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Open the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` with your actual Spotify credentials.

2. **YouTube Configuration:**

   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a new project.
   - Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project.
   - Generate an API key for your project.
   - Open the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with your actual YouTube API key.

## Usage

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the server, and you can now access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if you specified it in the environment configuration).

The API provides several endpoints for downloading music from both Spotify and YouTube. Refer to the API documentation for more details on how to use these endpoints effectively.

## API Documentation

The API documentation provides detailed information about each endpoint and the expected request and response formats. It also includes examples to help you get started quickly. Access the documentation at `http://localhost:3000/docs` once the server is running.
